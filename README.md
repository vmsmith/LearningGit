## Introduction

### Learning Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system. We'll discuss what that means exactly in a little bit. What's important for now is that knowing Git -- and how to use it -- is a skill that goes hand-in-hand with knowing how to write software. 

Having a GitHub repository is one of the things people sometimes want to see in job hiring situations. At a minimum a GitHub repository will allow people to examine your code. But it can also highlight your ability to work collaboratively with others, and it can demonstrate that you have been able to learn a somewhat sophisticated software system. In short, learning Git and GitHub in today's world is almost certainly worth it.

Git was developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) to better manage [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) development. That in and of itself ought to tell you something. Namely, that it was developed to manage a rather complex and arcane piece of software that has hundreds (perhaps thousands) of contributors world wide. And because of that, it probably has a lot more features and power than you (and I) are ever going to need.

Going hand-in-hand with what it is and why it was developed, it was developed by and for uber-geeks. As a result, both the official documentation as well as the help you can find via online forums and blog articles can be challenging.

I personally had a very hard time learning to use Git (and its companion, GitHub). It seemed as though almost everything I read assumed I already knew something that I usually did not know. That, combined with the fact that many software development geeks cannot write  very well to begin with, made learning it a painful process.

So this is a guide for poor fools like me who want to learn Git and GitHub in a logical, clear manner. 

### Layout

#### Step 0: [Getting Started](https://github.com/vmsmith/LearningGit/blob/master/0_Getting_Started.md)

* Downloading and installing Git
* Setting up your configurations
* Introduction to version control

#### Step 1: [Git and the Stand-alone Machine](https://github.com/vmsmith/LearningGit/blob/master/1_Stand_Alone_Machine.md)

* Initializing a repository
* The `.git` file
* The `.gitignore` file
* Tracking files with `add` and `add .`
* Checking the status with `status`
* Commiting files with `commit`
* Checking differences with `diff` and `diff HEAD`
* Viewing history with `log`
* Going back in time with `checkout`

#### Step 2: Using GitHub



#### Step 3: Working with a Collaborator



#### Step 4: Working with Multiple Collaborators
