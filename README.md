#### Learning Git and GitHub

This is a guide for poor fools like me who want to learn Git and GitHub in a logical, clear manner.

##### Step 0: Getting Started

* Downloading and installing Git
* Setting up your configurations
* Introduction to version control

##### Step 1: Git and the Stand-alone Machine

* Initializing a repository
* The `.git` file
* The `.gitignore` file
* Tracking files with `add` and `add .`
* Checking the status with `status`
* Commiting files with `commit`
* Checking differences with `diff` and `diff HEAD`
* Viewing history with `log`
* Going back in time with `checkout`

##### Step 2: Using GitHub
